USER asked to improve error messaging for an unconnected Chrome extension and simplify installation instructions. AGENT implemented clearer errors with links when not connected, updated code accordingly, requested a new npm token to publish v1.0.1, provided login steps using `npm login`, explained the E403 error due to 2FA requirement, instructed on how to add their authenticator app's 6-digit code for publishing with `--otp`.

Done: Error messaging was enhanced, new npm token acquired, `npm login` executed successfully; however, due to the E403 error caused by required 2FA during package publication, further action is needed from the user for publishing v1s success.
