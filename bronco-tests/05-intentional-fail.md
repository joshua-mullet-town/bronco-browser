# Test: Intentional Failure (Should Fail)

## Instructions
1. Navigate to https://example.com
2. Try to click a button with class "nonexistent-button"
3. This should fail because the element doesn't exist

## Expectations
- This test SHOULD FAIL
- The failure reason should indicate the element was not found
- This validates that our test runner correctly reports failures
